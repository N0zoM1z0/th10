# TH10 reconstruction handoff

Updated 2026-10-07. This is a concise resume brief, not an experiment journal.
Keep live totals in the generated [`PROGRESS.md`](PROGRESS.md), durable target
facts and negative results in [`KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`](KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md), and
experiment chronology in Git history. Do not copy transient probe scores,
scratch paths, or build hashes into this file.

## Authority and recovery

- Target only the original Japanese TH10 v1.00a executable at the ignored
  `resources/th10.exe`, SHA-256
  `2f14760b6fbbf57549541583283badb9a19a4222b90f0a146d5aa17f01dc9040`.
- Use `scripts/repo-python` for repository Python commands and keep target
  identity, boundary, origin, source presence, exact codegen, whole-product
  closure, runtime validation, semantics, and portability as separate claims.
- Work from the live worktree, including dirty changes. Inspect and continue,
  deliberately supersede, or reject existing work; do not create a clean side
  tree merely to avoid understanding it.
- Operator-requested commits use `gpt-web: ...`. Do not push from this worktree.
- Treat Ghidra, decompiler output, adjacent games, compiler diagnostics, and
  similarity scores as evidence or hypotheses according to their Oracle
  boundary. Only canonical replay can grant exact-codegen credit.
- Read current repository-wide counts from `docs/PROGRESS.md` or regenerate
  them. Do not reuse counts copied from an older commit or experiment.

## Active reconstruction order

1. **ECL Run — `EclVmContext::Run @ 0x0044E1A0`**
   - Keep the full target-owned 7,020-byte function in scope; do not reduce the
     problem to nearby leaf functions.
   - Rebuild diagnostics from the current source before judging a change.
   - Concentrate on x87/stack homes, FORMAT/shared-tail instruction shape,
     operand lifetimes, and private register allocation.
   - Replay only the canonical exact units actually affected by a bounded edit.
   - EclVmContext::ReadInt @ 0x0044FDB0 is now canonical exact at 144/144; treat its fixed typed-pop ESI lifetime as a closed constraint when changing Run or the Enemy dispatcher.

2. **ANM ExecuteScript — `AnmRenderManagerView::ExecuteScript @ 0x0043EE30`**
   - Preserve the reviewed 92 physical dispatch groups in target order.
   - Investigate loop-tail EDI reset/private register state and local/aggregate
     lifetimes rather than sorting the switch around a transient score.
   - Rebuild the linked diagnostic after support-source changes.

3. **Enemy dispatcher — `EnemyRuntimeView::DispatchEclInstruction @ 0x0040E770`**
   - Always regenerate the diagnostic baseline from current source first.
   - Prioritize ECL private calling conventions, laser construction,
     stack/frame layout, rank arithmetic, and x87 homes.

4. **Batch closure**
   - Interleave smaller non-exact Bullet/ECL functions when they constrain the
     large owners, but do not turn the project into a leaf-only queue.
   - After a coherent batch, run the broader tracking/progress/CI checks and the
     required focused exact replays.

## Recovery and verification

Start every resumed session by recovering the real worktree:

```sh
git status --short --branch
git diff --check
scripts/repo-python scripts/verify-target.py
scripts/repo-python scripts/verify-toolchain.py --execute
scripts/repo-python scripts/validate-tracking.py --require-target
scripts/repo-python scripts/report-reconstruction-status.py
```

For a bounded source change, use the narrowest relevant diagnostic first.
Before committing a coherent batch, run:

```sh
scripts/repo-python scripts/verify-toolchain.py --check
scripts/repo-python scripts/validate-tracking.py
scripts/repo-python scripts/progress.py
scripts/repo-python scripts/ci.py
git diff --check
```

Factory receipt acceptance is separate from a local replay or Git commit.
Never report a diagnostic size, similarity score, successful compile, or
checkpoint commit as exactness.

## Scratch and cleanup policy

- `.analysis/` and `build/` are disposable working state, not durable records.
  Keep scratch only while an unresolved claim needs it.
- Before pruning scratch, preserve retained source edits in Git and move durable
  conclusions into source, ledgers, reusable scripts, or `KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`.
- Remove superseded probes, decompiler dumps, logs, generated PE/PDB/OBJ files,
  stale build trees, and Python caches after a bounded batch.
- Historical evidence rows may name deleted `.analysis/...` or `build/...`
  paths as provenance. Those paths are not promised to exist.
- Point-in-time audit snapshots belong in Git history once their durable accepted
  conclusions have been absorbed into source, ledgers, and `KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`;
  do not keep obsolete snapshot reports on the live documentation surface.
- Keep `ghidra-project/`, `.tools/`, `_reference/`, and `resources/th10.exe`;
  they are private analysis state, pinned tools/reference material, and the
  canonical private target rather than generic build debris.
